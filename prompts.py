Decompose the "Content" into clear and simple propositions, ensuring they are interpretable out of original context. 
Provide the propositions as a LIST OF STRINGS, in {source_language} language.
1. Split compound sentence into simple sentences. Maintain the original phrasing from the input whenever possible.
2. For any named entity that is accompanied by additional descriptive information, separate this information into its own distinct proposition.
3. Decontextualize the proposition by adding necessary modifier to nouns or entire sentences and replacing pronouns (e.g., "it", "he", "she", "they", "this", "that") with the full name of the entities they refer to.
4. Present the results as a LIST OF STRINGS, in source language of the "Content" which is {source_language}.

Example:
Input: Title: Â¯Eostre. Section: Theories and interpretations, Connection to Easter Hares. Content:
The earliest evidence for the Easter Hare (Osterhase) was recorded in south-west Germany in
1678 by the professor of medicine Georg Franck von Franckenau, but it remained unknown in
other parts of Germany until the 18th century. Scholar Richard Sermon writes that "hares were
frequently seen in gardens in spring, and thus may have served as a convenient explanation for the
origin of the colored eggs hidden there for children. Alternatively, there is a European tradition
that hares laid eggs, since a hare's scratch or form and a lapwing's nest look very similar, and
both occur on grassland and are first seen in the spring. In the nineteenth century the influence
of Easter cards, toys, and books was to make the Easter Hare/Rabbit popular throughout Europe.
German immigrants then exported the custom to Britain and America where it evolved into the
Easter Bunny."

Determine whether or not the "Proposition" should belong to any of the existing chunks.

A proposition should belong to a chunk if their meaning, direction, or intentions are very similar. Be precise and strict in your judgement. 
The goal is to group only highly similar propositions and chunks provided in {source_language}.

If a proposition clearly fits within an existing chunk, return the "Chunk ID" without providing any explanations.
If the proposition does not clearly belong to an existing chunk, even if there is some overlap, return "No chunks" to indicate it should not be joined with any of the current chunks.

Example:
Input:
    - Proposition: "Greg really likes hamburgers"

    - Current Chunks:
        - Chunk ID: 2n4l3d
